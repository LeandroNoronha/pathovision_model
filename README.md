# research_project-unisinos

This repository is dedicated to the development of my final paper at 
Unisinos. It includes all the code implementations and written content, 
structured in LaTeX while adhering to ABNT standards. The repository 
serves as a comprehensive workspace for organizing research, 
experiments, and documentation, ensuring consistency and proper 
formatting throughout the project.
